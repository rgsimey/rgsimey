# Simon Ross-Gill ### Isle of Arran, Scotland

Hi there, 

I am using Github to serve 4 websites on the Isle of Arran, Scotland for organisations that I am involved with as a volunteer and social entrepreneur.

* [The Arran Pioneer Project CIC](https://pioneerproject.scot)
* [The Arran Green Map](https://arrangreenmap.co.uk/)
* [Arran Huts](https://arranhuts.scot/)
* [Love Millstone Point](https://lovemillstonepoint.com/)

And one for profit website, which is my own graphic design portfolio - https://www.rgsimey.scot/ contact me for page layout, map design, illustration and book design.

## Web Design

The websites are built using open source frameworks for HTML5 / CSS3 that are free to use, and come highly recommended. Full details in the Readmes for each website.

* [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/)
* [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/)
