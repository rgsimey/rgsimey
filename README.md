Hi there, I am using Github to serve 4 websites in the Isle of Arran, Scotland for organisations that I am involved with as a volunteer and social entrepreneur.

* The Arran Pioneer Project CIC
* The Arran Green Map
* Arran Huts
* Love Millstone Point

And one for profit website, which is my own graphic design portfolio - https://www.rgsimey.scot/ contact me for page layout, map design, illustration and book design.

## Web Design

The websites are built using open source frameworks for HTML5 / CSS3 that are free to use, and come highly recommended. Full details in the Readmes for each website.

* Start Bootstrap (http://startbootstrap.com/)
* HTML5UP (https://html5up.net/)
